**Name:** Greg Mingas
**About me:** I work as a Senior Research Data Scientist in the Turing's REG team. I am the REG lead in the project. I have  a background in MCMC algorithms, parallel hardware (FPGAs) and data science in various commercial applications. I worked for 3 years for easyJet, where I applied data science techniques to applications such as food waste minimisation, ticket pricing and predictive maintenance. Within the Turing, I contributed to synthetic data, MCMC and air traffic control research and to the Turing data science training course.
