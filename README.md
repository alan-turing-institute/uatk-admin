## About this Repository

Welcome to the Science of Cities and Regions admin repository. The Science of Cities and Regions is an Alan Turing Institute project, aiming to produce a step change in the science of cities by the application of next generation AI and data science to address major challenges and opportunities for society, the economy and underpinning infrastructure. The project comprises four missions:
- Urban Mobility
- Land Use Planning
- Spatial inequalities and sustainability
- Digital Twins

A core part of the project is the **Urban Analytics Technology Platform (UATP)**, an ecosystem of software tools, data products and documentation.

This repository contains high-level planning and governance information for the project, onboarding information for new members of the team, and other admin and random information. It also contains high level information about the UATP ecosystem and links to the UATP repositories, data and documentation.

This repository follows the recommendations and guidance provided in *[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)* handbook to data science and was generated based on the [Turing Way's reproducible project template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/reproducible-project-template).

## Getting started

Please read:
- [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 
- [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Communication within the project

Since we're a distributed team, we aim to document everything so that it's visible to everyone in the project. 

### Regular meetings

There is an overview of regular meetings at [`uatk-admin/meetings.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-admin/blob/main/meetings.md). Please edit if anything is missing or incorrect.

### Communication channels

- [Slack #ua-confidential channel](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDg3Nzc4MTI0MTIwMS0wYzhiOTdjOGRlODE2MmNjYzA3YmM2ZDBmZDQ3OTI2MzJkYjE3MGE0YWMzY2U5MWZiNDk3NjdiYmU2ZGJkZGE4) is for informal communication between team members.
- [Slack #urbananalytics channel](https://join.slack.com/share/enQtNDg2NTAzOTYwMTY2Ny1mNmFhNjNlMjk0OTZkNTYxNWExMWE1NDU2ZmEwNjYzYmVmMzAyMWQxYmRkNWMyOTA2NTg0NWM2ZjA1NTNlNmYy) is an all-Turing channel where we post about UA activity.
- Technical discussion should happen in issues on the relevant project's Github repo or in this repo for more high-level topics.
